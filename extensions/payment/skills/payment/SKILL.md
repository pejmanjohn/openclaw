# Payment

## Prerequisites

To use the `stripe-link` provider, the Stripe Link CLI must be installed and on your `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g @stripe/link-cli
```

- Minimum required version: `0.4.0`
- A Link account with at least one saved payment method
- The Link mobile app on your phone (for biometric approval)

The plugin config defaults `providers["stripe-link"].command` to `"link-cli"`. If you install the binary under a different name or path, set that config key accordingly.

---

Use this skill when you need to make a purchase using the OpenClaw payment plugin. Two paths exist:

- **Virtual card checkout** — issue a single-use card, fill a browser form using sentinels, submit the checkout.
- **Machine payment** — call an HTTP 402 endpoint directly using `execute_machine_payment`. No browser required.

Always check setup and list funding sources before attempting a purchase.

## Step 1 — Verify setup

```json
{ "action": "setup_status" }
```

If `available` is `false`, report the `reason` to the user and stop. Do not attempt a purchase with an unavailable provider.

## Step 2 — List funding sources

```json
{ "action": "list_funding_sources" }
```

Pick an appropriate funding source whose `rails` array includes `virtual_card` (for browser checkout) or `machine_payment` (for HTTP 402 endpoints). Record the `id` — you will need it in every subsequent action.

## Step 3A — Virtual card checkout

### Issue the card

Call `payment.issue_virtual_card` with a `purchaseIntent` of at least 100 characters. The intent text is shown to the user during the Stripe Link approval prompt on their phone — be specific about what is being purchased and why.

```json
{
  "action": "issue_virtual_card",
  "providerId": "stripe-link",
  "fundingSourceId": "<id from step 2>",
  "amount": { "amountCents": 2999, "currency": "usd" },
  "merchant": {
    "name": "Example Store",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "purchaseIntent": "Purchasing a blue widget (SKU W-123) from example.com for $29.99. The user asked to buy this item as part of their home office setup order placed on 2026-04-30."
}
```

This action requires **warning-severity approval** in the OpenClaw approval surface, followed by a **biometric approval** (Face ID or passkey) on the user's Link mobile app. The tool call will block until both approvals resolve. Do not attempt to poll or retry while the call is pending.

On success, the result contains:

- `handle.id` — record this; you need it for fill and status checks.
- `handle.validUntil` — the card expires at this timestamp.
- `handle.display` — non-secret display info (`brand`, `last4`, `expMonth`, `expYear`).
- `fillSentinels` — a map with keys `pan`, `cvv`, `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `exp_mm_yy`, `exp_mm_yyyy`, `holder_name`, `billing_line1`, `billing_city`, `billing_state`, `billing_postal_code`, `billing_country`. Each value is a sentinel object `{ "$paymentHandle": "<id>", "field": "<name>" }`.

> **Test-mode note:** In test mode, Stripe Link always returns "Jane Doe" as the holder name regardless of the buyer's actual name. This is expected; production cards will use the buyer's real name from their Link account.

If `handle.status` is `denied`, tell the user their approval was denied and stop. Do not retry `issue_virtual_card` without user instruction.

### Open the merchant checkout

Use the `browser` tool to navigate to the merchant's checkout or payment page. Take a snapshot to identify the card form fields.

```json
{ "action": "open", "url": "https://example.com/checkout", "label": "checkout" }
```

```json
{ "action": "snapshot", "targetId": "checkout" }
```

### Fill the form with sentinels

Pass the sentinel objects as field values in a `browser.act fill` call. Do not look up or substitute the real card values yourself — the payment plugin's hook handles substitution automatically.

This call triggers a **critical-severity approval** for the sentinel substitution. On approval, the payment plugin substitutes real card values inside the runtime — those values are typed into the browser form but never appear in your transcript or the agent's view of the parameters.

## Browser-fill examples

Each `BrowserFormField` entry **must** use the `{ "ref", "type", "value" }` shape. The `ref` is a CSS selector or element ref; `type` is `"text"` for card fields.

### For split MM / YY forms (older / non-Stripe Elements forms)

Use `exp_month` and `exp_year` sentinels when the form has two separate expiry fields:

```json
{
  "action": "act",
  "request": {
    "kind": "fill",
    "fields": [
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cardnumber']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "pan" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='exp-month']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "exp_month" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='exp-year']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "exp_year" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cvc']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "cvv" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cardholder']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "holder_name" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### For combined MM/YY forms (Stripe Elements, modern checkouts)

Use `exp_mm_yy` when the form has a **single combined expiry field** (e.g. `input[name='exp-date']`). The value is formatted as `MM/YY` (e.g. `"12/30"`). Use `exp_mm_yyyy` for `MM/YYYY` format (e.g. `"12/2030"`).

```json
{
  "action": "act",
  "request": {
    "kind": "fill",
    "fields": [
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cardnumber']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "pan" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='exp-date']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "exp_mm_yy" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cvc']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "cvv" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='name']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "holder_name" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When the form has a single MM/YY field, use `field: "exp_mm_yy"` (year as 2 digits, slash-separated) or `field: "exp_mm_yyyy"` (year as 4 digits, slash-separated). Both are pre-formatted with a `/` separator so you do not need to combine the separate month and year values yourself.

### For forms with billing address fields

Use the billing address sentinels when the checkout form asks for the cardholder's address. These are sourced from `card.billing_address` in the Link card response.

```json
{
  "action": "act",
  "request": {
    "kind": "fill",
    "fields": [
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cardnumber']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "pan" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='exp-date']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "exp_mm_yy" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='cvc']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "cvv" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='name']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "holder_name" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='address-line1']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "billing_line1" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='address-city']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "billing_city" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='address-state']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "billing_state" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='address-zip']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "billing_postal_code" }
      },
      {
        "ref": "input[name='address-country']",
        "type": "text",
        "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "billing_country" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Available billing address fields: `billing_line1`, `billing_city`, `billing_state`, `billing_postal_code`, `billing_country`. These correspond to the fields returned by `link-cli spend-request retrieve --include card` under `card.billing_address`.

### Sentinel resolution model (two tiers + forward-compat passthrough)

The fill-hook resolves each sentinel `field` by name against a two-tier data model populated by the adapter:

- **Tier 1 — card secrets** (always present): `pan`, `cvv`, `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `exp_mm_yy`, `exp_mm_yyyy`. These are strictly card-secret and never persisted; the redaction-hook scans for them by pattern.
- **Tier 2 — buyer profile** (provider-dependent): `holder_name`, `billing_line1`, `billing_city`, `billing_state`, `billing_postal_code`, `billing_country`. Populated when the provider response includes `card.billing_address`. Skipped silently when missing — the fill-hook reports a clear "field not available" error rather than silently filling an empty string.
- **Tier 3 — forward-compat extras**: any string-typed top-level field on the provider response that isn't structurally captured by Tier 1/2. Adapters auto-pass-through these so agents can use new field names the moment the provider exposes them.

### Safety boundary

The forward-compat passthrough is deliberately narrow. Plugin operators and reviewers should understand its exact scope:

- **String-typed top-level fields only.** The adapter only passes through fields whose value is a primitive `string` at the top level of the provider response (`card.*` and `card.billing_address.*`). Object-typed fields such as `card.tokenization: { token: "..." }` are never passed through, even if they contain a nested string.
- **Agent must explicitly name each field.** Passthrough does not run automatically. The agent must include `field: "<name>"` in the sentinel object. Unknown field names fail fast with a `block: true` error that lists exactly which fields are available. There is no wildcard, glob, or bulk-passthrough mode.
- **The `before_message_write` redaction hook scans by pattern, not by key name.** The hook checks every outgoing assistant message for PAN-shape (13-19 digit Luhn-valid) strings and CVV-context strings regardless of which key they are under. If a future provider response were to put unexpected card data under an unexpected extras field, the redaction hook would catch it at the persistence boundary.
- **Recommendation for plugin operators.** Before approving a fill request, review the field-name list shown in the approval prompt — it is always explicit. The well-known safe fields are: `pan`, `cvv`, `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `exp_mm_yy`, `exp_mm_yyyy`, `holder_name`, `billing_line1`, `billing_city`, `billing_state`, `billing_postal_code`, `billing_country`. Any field outside this list is a forward-compat extra and should be scrutinized before approval.

**Forward-compat passthrough — example.** If link-cli starts exposing `card.email`, you can use `field: "email"` in a fill call right away with no plugin update:

```json
{
  "ref": "input[name='email']",
  "type": "email",
  "value": { "$paymentHandle": "<handle-id>", "field": "email" }
}
```

If the provider has populated the field, the value substitutes normally. If not, the fill-hook fails fast with `block: true` and an error message that lists the fields that ARE available for this credential — for example:

```
payment fill: field "email" is not available for this credential. Available fields: billing_city, billing_country, billing_line1, billing_postal_code, billing_state, cvv, exp_mm_yy, exp_mm_yyyy, exp_month, exp_year, holder_name, pan
```

When you see that error, treat it as ground truth: the listed fields are the complete set this credential can fill. Pick a different field, or tell the user which form field can't be auto-filled.

> **Today's Stripe Link surface (link-cli 0.4.0):** the provider currently only populates the 12 well-known fields above. `email`, `phone`, `shipping_*`, etc. are NOT yet exposed and will fail with the message above. The Stripe team has indicated `email`, `phone`, and `shipping_address` are coming; once they ship, no plugin update is required — the agent can simply start using the field names.

### Common mistakes

- **Wrong:** `{ "selector": "...", "text": ... }` — this is NOT the BrowserFormField shape.
- **Wrong:** `{ "name": "...", "value": ... }` — also NOT the correct shape.
- **Right:** `{ "ref": "<css-selector or ref>", "type": "text", "value": <sentinel> }`

Do not attempt to pass the sentinel object under any key other than `value`. Do not stringify the sentinel — pass it as a plain object.

### Submit the form

After a successful fill approval, submit the form:

```json
{
  "action": "act",
  "request": { "kind": "click", "ref": "<submit button ref>", "targetId": "checkout" }
}
```

Take a snapshot to confirm the checkout succeeded.

### Handle failures and retry

If the checkout fails (3DS challenge, network error, form validation error, browser timeout):

1. Do NOT issue a new virtual card immediately.
2. Re-snapshot the checkout page to understand the current state.
3. If a 3DS challenge appeared, wait for the user to complete it (or dismiss it), then retry the fill on the same handle. Each retry fill requires a new critical-severity approval.
4. If the page shows a card decline or a permanent error, use `payment.get_payment_status` to check the handle status before deciding.
5. If `get_payment_status` returns `{ status: "approved" }` and `validUntil` is in the future, the card is still usable — retry the fill.
6. If `get_payment_status` returns `{ status: "expired" }` or the fill hook returns a `card_unavailable` error, the card has been consumed or has expired. Issue a new virtual card (back to Step 3A) and inform the user that a new approval is needed.

**EU/PSD2 note:** 3DS challenges are expected for European-issued cards and many European merchants. Treat a 3DS modal as a retry trigger, not a failure. The same handle can be reused for multiple fill attempts until `validUntil` expires.

## Step 3B — Machine payment (HTTP 402 endpoint)

Use this path for services that accept payments over HTTP using the Machine Payments Protocol. No browser is involved.

```json
{
  "action": "execute_machine_payment",
  "providerId": "stripe-link",
  "fundingSourceId": "<id from step 2>",
  "targetUrl": "https://api.example.com/purchase",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": { "item": "widget-123" },
  "idempotencyKey": "optional-dedup-key"
}
```

This action requires **critical-severity approval**. The approval description explicitly marks the action as irreversible once settled.

On success, the result includes `outcome` (`settled | failed | pending`) and a redacted `receipt`. No spend request token (SPT) or raw payment credential appears in the result.

If `outcome` is `failed`, do not automatically retry. Report the failure to the user and ask for instructions. If retrying is appropriate, reuse the same `idempotencyKey` to avoid double-charges.

## Recovery decision tree

```
fill returns card_unavailable?
  └─ yes → issue new virtual card (new approval needed)
  └─ no

handle.status == expired?
  └─ yes → issue new virtual card
  └─ no

3DS challenge appeared?
  └─ yes → wait for user, retry fill (new critical approval)
  └─ no

decline or permanent error?
  └─ yes → report to user, do not retry automatically
  └─ no

validUntil in the future?
  └─ yes → retry fill (new critical approval)
  └─ no → issue new virtual card
```

## What you will never see

The payment plugin guarantees the following. Do not attempt to work around these limits:

- Real PAN, CVV, expiry digits, or holder name will never appear in any tool result.
- `fillSentinels` values are opaque reference objects, not card data.
- After a successful fill, the browser tab contains real card values that you typed, but those values are not returned to you in any tool result.

If you receive an unexpected card-shaped string in a tool result, stop and report it to the user as a possible security issue.
